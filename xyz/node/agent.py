@description:
This module implements the foundational class for an AI-Agent. An AI-Agent is a callable entity designed to receive
input and return output. Users can create new AI-Agents by inheriting from this class. The flexibility of AI-Agent
allows users to inherit and implement their custom logic within the Agent.flowing() method, accommodating any
programming logic.

## Features of the AI-Agent include:
- Callable: AI-Agents can be invoked using the `agent()` method.
- Information Configuration: Users can set the properties of the AI-Agent using the `set_information()` method, adhering
    to the function call format specified by OpenAI.
- Nestability: AI-Agents can be nested within other AI-Agents.
- Structural Visibility: The structure of the AI-Agent can be inspected using the `__str__()` method, which can be
    directly printed using `print(agent)`.

## Motivation
AI-Agents leverage large language models and flexible programming combinations to achieve diverse functionalities.
The purpose of this class is to facilitate the encapsulation of custom AI-Agents for use within systems. AI-Agents also
provide foundational support for self-driving multi-agent systems. For detailed information, please refer to the
documentation and papers associated with this project.
